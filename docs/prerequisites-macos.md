# Feel Explorer installation for MacOS

## Prerequisites

These programs and resources are required to install and run Feel Explorer.

- Node.js v8.11.2 or higher (<https://nodejs.org/>) -- Node.js serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

    ```bash
    brew update
    brew doctor
    brew install node
    ```

- Install `wget` -- used for downloading files

    ```bash
    brew install wget
    ```

- Git (<https://github.com/git/git>) -- Used for cloning and updating Feel Service

    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

- Tool chain components -- Used for compiling dependencies

    ```bash
    brew install automake autoconf libtool
    ```

- Redis (<http://redis.io>) -- Redis is used for caching parsed exchange data.
	```bash
	brew install redis
	```

	> Note: you can change your port at this step if you want to have more Redis instances in the future. Remember to adjust the environment variable `REDIS_PORT` accordingly.

- Freegeoip (<https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip>) -- Freegeoip is used by the Network Monitor for IP address geo-location.
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip/releases/download/v3.4.1/freegeoip-3.4.1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
    tar -zxf freegeoip-3.4.1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
    ln -s freegeoip-3.4.1-darwin-amd64 freegeoip
    nohup ./freegeoip/freegeoip > ./freegeoip/freegeoip.log 2>&1 &
    ```

- Update `npm` to the version 6.x

    ```bash
    npm install -g npm@6
    ```

- PM2 (https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) -- PM2 manages the node process for Feel Service and handles log rotation (Highly Recommended)

    ```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    ```

- Bower (<https://bower.io/>) -- Bower is used to look after frontend libraries.

    ```
    sudo npm install -g bower
    ```
